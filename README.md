# HOT OR NOT #
This website features a dynamic image comparison setup inspired by "Hot or Not." It allows users to view two images side by side, encouraging interaction through a voting mechanism where users select which of the two images they prefer. The chosen image "wins" and remains on the screen, while the other is replaced with the next image from a pre-loaded array. This cycle continues, allowing users to progressively vote on images, which creates a visually engaging experience that ranks images based on user preferences. The code incorporates looping, so once all images have been displayed, it starts from the beginning, ensuring continuous interaction without interruption. This engaging comparison system is designed to highlight popular images and keep users actively engaged with fresh content.
